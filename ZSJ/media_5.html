      Female Speaker: The Obama's are staying in D.C. for two
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
     Chuck Todd: He's about to go from Commander in Chief
    </p>
    <p>
      to Couch Commander.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President: -- you, Chuck Todd.
    </p>
    <p>
  What am I going to do in D.C. for two years?
    </p>
    <p>
   (music)
    </p>
    <p>
     The Vice President: Get around to London,
    </p>
    <p>
    Mr. President.
    </p>
    <p>
    The President: I can't go every day, can I?
    </p>
    <p>
  The Vice President: Which do you like better?
    </p>
    <p>
  These?
    </p>
    <p>
     Or These?
    </p>
    <p>
 The President: Joe, they're the same.
    </p>
    <p>
  The Vice President: They capture different moods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President: Joe, I need some focus here.

    </p>
    <p>
 
The Vice President: Coming in here during aviator time,
    </p>
    <p>
     thinks everything --
    </p>
    <p>
  The President: I'm sorry, what's that?
    </p>
    <p>
The Vice President: I said, Mr. President,

    </p>
    <p>
	you got to be practical.
    </p>
    <p>
	And look, you can drive again,

    </p>
    <p>
      you're going to need a license.
	  </p>
    <p>
      You love sports, why don't you volunteer to work one of
    </p>
    <p>
the teams around here?
    </p>
    <p>
     (music) 
    </p>
    <p>
      The President: Is this the Washington Wizards?
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand you're looking for some coaching help.

    </p>
    <p>
      Let's just say I coached my daughter's team a few times.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hello?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hello?
    </p>
    <p>
    (music)
    </p>
    <p>
    Female Speaker: 44.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President: Finally.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, I'm going to be in D.C. for awhile,
    </p>
    <p>
      and I thought I'd take up driving again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Female Speaker: What's the name? 
    </p>
    <p>
      The President: Barack Hussein Obama.
    </p>
    <p>
     Female Speaker: Yikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, since you don't have a driver's license,
    </p>
    <p>
     you're going to need a birth certificate.
    </p>
    <p>
 The President: Really?
    </p>
    <p>
     Female Speaker: Really. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The President: It's real.
    </p>
    <p>
      Female Speaker: Is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      The President: It's real.

    </p>
    <p>
     Female Speaker: But is it?
    </p>
    <p>
     (music)
    </p>
    <p>
     The President: Oh.

    </p>
    <p>
    Michelle left her phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's see here.
    </p>
    <p>
   Huh.
    </p>
    <p>
  She's got Snapchat.

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
     Wolf Blitzer: Michelle Obama in hot water,
    </p>
    <p>
   after posting this video earlier today.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President: Obamacare is great!
    </p>
    <p>
And it's really working!

    </p>
    <p>
      Sign up now!
    </p>
    <p>
     No?
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs. Obama: No.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President: Did it get a lot of views, at least?
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs. Obama: Honey, enough.

    </p>
    <p>
  Enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why don't you just talk to somebody who has been
    </p>
    <p>
     through this. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I got to go to SoulCycle.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President: She's right.

    </p>
    <p>
     I know who I need to talk to.
    </p>
    <p>
  Hey.
    </p>
    <p>
It's Barack.

    </p>
    <p>
  Listen, could we get together.
    </p>
    <p>
 (music)

    </p>
    <p>
Now that is a great movie.
    </p>
    <p>
     John Boehner: Yeah.
    </p>
    <p>
     It gets me every time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tom Hanks: So long, partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      (music)
    </p>
    <p>
The President: So, you got any advice for me?
    </p>
	<p>
	John Boehner: So now you want my advice?
	</p>
	<p>
	First, stop sending me all these LinkedIn requests.
	</p>
     <p>
	 And second, here's the beauty of this whole thing.
	</p>
	<p>
	You've got all the time in the world to figure this out.
	</p>
	<p>
You can just be you for awhile.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you know how to do that again.
	</p>
	<p>
	The President: So I can just be me.
	</p>
	<p>
	(music)
	</p>
	<p>
	And I can wear my mom jeans in peace.
	</p>
	<p>
	I hate these tight jeans.
	</p>
	<p>
	John Boehner: That's good.
	</p>
	<p>
	That's good.
	</p>
	<p>
	Yesterday, I had a beer at 11:30 in the morning.
	</p>
	<p>
	And you know, McDonalds now serves breakfast all day long.
	</p>
	<p>
	The President: And Michelle's going to be at

	</p>
	<p>
	spin class, so she'll never know.

	</p>
	<p>
	John Boehner: Right.
	</p>
	<p>
	Let it go.
	</p>
	<p>
	And it won't be long, you'll be able to walk right out of
	</p>
	<p>
	the Oval Office singing Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah
	</p>
	<p>
	Zip-a-Dee-Day.
	</p>
	<p>
	(laughter)

	</p>
	<p>
	And you've got plenty of time to work on your tan.
	</p>
	<p>
	And you know what?
	</p>
	<p>
	I finally got the grand bargain on a sweet Chevy Tahoe.
	</p>
	<p>
	Look here.
	</p>
	<p>
	Look here.
	</p>
	<p>
	You want one?
	</p>
	<p>
	Wolf Blitzer: Breaking news.
	</p>
	<p>
	Former President Barack Obama on his 347th round of
	</p>
	<p>
	golf for the year, and it's totally great.
	</p>
	<p>
	And Gloria, not a problem for anybody.
	</p>
	<p>
	Gloria Borger: I can't think of a reason to care, Wolf.
	</p>
	<p>
	And believe me, I've tried.
	</p>
	<p>
	(music)
